description: In rough-and-tumble Chicago, honest, idealistic Charlie Bannon finds
  he needs all his intelligence, drive, and negotiating skills to build a modern grain
  elevator and a suspension bridge. In his way are greedy stockbrokers and mediocre,
  shortsighted opponents. Ayn Rand (author of Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead
  ) called this 1901 book one of her favorite novels.
